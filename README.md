# Diablo 2 Mouse Capture (`D2MC`)

Simple program to limit mouse movement to specific Diablo 2 game instance.

_________________
Use files from D2MC `Download and Install` folder to install this simple application.


### Features:
- D2MC works for multiple Diablo 2 game instances
- Confines mouse movement to Diablo 2 `client` borders
- Smooth mouse movement on `client` borders
- Mouse cannot reach `window` borders and `window` caption
- NumPad Diablo 2 `window` switcher (use Num keys from 1 to 8)
- Diablo 2 `window` minimizer (use space to minimize all windows)
- Mouse locker/unlocker (use ctrl+E to lock mouse or unlock it)

### Issues:

> **Switching Diablo 2 window instances will not set up current window as foreground window**
>
> *After switching windows click on current/new window to make it foreground window*

> **Starting multiple instances of this application very fast will cause problems with switching**
>
> *Start next instance after Diablo 2 window appears*

> **Do not terminate this application process. It will close automatically after closing of all Diablo 2 instances**
>
> Delete ***D2MC.db*** file if you have terminated D2MC process
