# Diablo 2 Mouse Capture (`D2MC`)

Simple program to limit mouse movement to specific Diablo 2 game instance.

_________________
Use files from D2MC `Download and Install` folder to install this simple application.


### Features:
- D2MC works with multiple Diablo 2 game instances
- Support for vanilla and PlugY (it should work with D2SE also [not tested])
- Confines mouse movement to Diablo 2 `client` borders
- Smooth mouse movement on `client` borders
- Mouse cannot reach `window` borders and `window` caption
- NumPad Diablo 2 `window` switcher (use Num keys from 1 to 8)
- Diablo 2 `window` minimizer (use space to minimize all windows)
- Mouse locker/unlocker (use ctrl+E to lock mouse or unlock it)

### Read before use:

> **Always run D2MC as administrator**
>
> *Create a shortcut of D2MC.exe on desktop, right click and set to run it as administrator by default*

> **Switching Diablo 2 window instances will not set up current window as foreground window**
>
> *After switching windows click on current/new window to make it as foreground window*

> **Starting multiple instances of this application very fast will cause problems with switching**
>
> *Start next instance after Diablo 2 window appears*

> **D2MC will terminate itself after 10 seconds if there is no Diablo II window instance**
>
> *Make sure to start Diablo II fast enough via D2SE or click fast enough on UAC popup*

> **Do not terminate this application process. It will close automatically after closing of all Diablo 2 instances**
>
> Delete ***D2MC.db*** file if you have terminated D2MC process

> **D2MC.bat file is used by D2MC.exe because only this way it can support PlugY...**
>
> Set Diablo II executable (Diablo II.exe, PlugY.exe or D2SE.exe) and all necessary parameters you need

> I suggest to keep all Diablo II window instances in the same position and move between them via numpad
